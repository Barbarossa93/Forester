# Forester

Here are the dotfiles for my laptop setup on the latest herbstluftwm-git. These dots are quite a mess, so I probably forgot something. If I did, feel free to open an issue and ask!

NOTE: These dots are intended for my setup, so if you wish to use them (and feel free to do so!) you will have to adapt them to your machine
